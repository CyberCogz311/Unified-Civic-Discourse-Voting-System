Unified Civic Discourse Voting System
Overview
This project aims to create a voting system integrated into a civic engagement application that allows users to participate in non-binary voting processes related to political issues and peaceful activism. The system is designed to empower users to organize, promote awareness, and engage in political discussion.

The app leverages real-time updates through Socket.io and integrates gamification by rewarding users with tokens or points for completing tasks associated with political actions (e.g., supporting specific causes, signing petitions, attending protests). Blockchain technology will ensure transparency and decentralization in the voting process.

Features
Non-Binary Voting: Voters can choose from multiple options (e.g., "Strongly Agree", "Agree", "Neutral", "Disagree", "Strongly Disagree") rather than just Yes/No.
Real-Time Voting: Updates are displayed instantly on the user's interface (e.g., projected on a wall, TV, or screen).
Gamification: Users earn rewards (tokens) for completing certain tasks such as participating in voting, attending peaceful protests, or organizing political awareness campaigns.
Decentralization & Transparency: The voting data and rewards are stored securely using blockchain technology.
Technologies Used
Frontend: React, Redux, Socket.io Client
Backend: Node.js, Express, Socket.io Server
Blockchain: Ethereum (for smart contracts and token rewards)
Database: MongoDB (for storing voting data and user tasks)
