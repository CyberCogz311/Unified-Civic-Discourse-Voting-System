Creating a blockchain-based voting system that updates in real-time and guarantees accuracy is an ambitious but achievable task. The goal of such a system is to ensure transparency, immutability, and accountability of the votes while providing real-time updates to users. Blockchain technology inherently provides a secure and immutable way to store data, and integrating this into an app for both iOS and Android is possible using appropriate tools and frameworks.

Here's a general blueprint and example code to implement the blockchain voting system:

1. Blockchain Concept for Voting
A blockchain-based voting system operates by storing each vote as a transaction on the blockchain. Every vote is immutable once it’s recorded, ensuring integrity and security. The system must support:

Real-time updates: When a vote is cast, the app should reflect that update almost immediately, showing users current results.
Non-repudiation: No one can alter or delete votes after they've been recorded.
Transparency: Users should be able to see how many people voted for each option and ensure that the vote counting process is not manipulated.
For this purpose, we’ll use Ethereum (with Smart Contracts) as an example blockchain platform, and the app will interact with this smart contract to store and retrieve votes.

2. Smart Contract for Blockchain Voting
A smart contract is a program that runs on the blockchain. This contract defines the rules and logic for how votes are cast and counted. Below is a simplified version of a smart contract written in Solidity for Ethereum.

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Voting {
    struct Issue {
        uint256 id;
        string name;
        string description;
        mapping(address => bool) voted; // To ensure one vote per address
        mapping(uint256 => uint256) votes; // Mapping of vote options to vote count
    }

    mapping(uint256 => Issue) public issues;
    uint256 public issueCount;
    
    // Event to emit when a vote is cast
    event VoteCast(uint256 issueId, uint256 optionId, address voter);

    // Function to create a voting issue
    function createIssue(string memory name, string memory description) public {
        issueCount++;
        issues[issueCount].id = issueCount;
        issues[issueCount].name = name;
        issues[issueCount].description = description;
    }

    // Function to vote on a specific issue
    function vote(uint256 issueId, uint256 optionId) public {
        Issue storage issue = issues[issueId];
        
        // Check if the user has already voted
        require(!issue.voted[msg.sender], "You have already voted!");
        
        // Record the vote
        issue.votes[optionId]++;
        issue.voted[msg.sender] = true;
        
        // Emit vote cast event
        emit VoteCast(issueId, optionId, msg.sender);
    }

    // Function to get the current vote count for an option
    function getVotes(uint256 issueId, uint256 optionId) public view returns (uint256) {
        return issues[issueId].votes[optionId];
    }

    // Function to get all issues
    function getAllIssues() public view returns (Issue[] memory) {
        Issue[] memory allIssues = new Issue[](issueCount);
        for (uint256 i = 1; i <= issueCount; i++) {
            allIssues[i-1] = issues[i];
        }
        return allIssues;
    }
}

This smart contract allows you to:

Create voting issues with a name and description.
Allow users to vote on an issue (with multiple options) and ensure that they can only vote once.
Track votes by incrementing the count for each option.
Emit real-time events (VoteCast) that will notify external systems (e.g., your app) when a new vote is cast.
Retrieve the current vote count for each option.

3. Backend Server to Interact with Blockchain
For real-time updates in your app, you need a backend server that listens to events from the blockchain and sends them to your mobile app in real-time. This backend will be responsible for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and updating the voting status on the client app.

You can use Node.js with the web3.js library to connect to the Ethereum blockchain.

const Web3 = require('web3');
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const http = require('http').Server(app);
const io = require('socket.io')(http);

// Initialize Web3 and connect to the Ethereum node
const web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider('http://localhost:8545')); // Local or Infura provider

const contractABI = [ /* ABI from the compiled Solidity contract */ ];
const contractAddress = 'YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS'; // Deployed contract address

const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(contractABI, contractAddress);

// Listen for 'VoteCast' events
contract.events.VoteCast()
    .on('data', event => {
        console.log('Vote Cast:', event.returnValues);
        io.emit('newVote', event.returnValues);  // Emit real-time event to clients
    })
    .on('error', console.error);

// Express server for API (optional)
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Voting System API');
});

// Start server
http.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});

This backend does the following:

Connects to the Ethereum network using Web3.js.
Listens for events (VoteCast) from the smart contract. When a vote is cast, it will emit this event to the mobile app via Socket.io.
Exposes a basic Express API for future extensions (e.g., fetch voting issues, get results, etc.).

4. Frontend for iOS and Android (React Native)
For the mobile app, we’ll use React Native to create a cross-platform app for both iOS and Android. We'll integrate it with the backend server using Socket.io for real-time updates and display the voting issues.

React Native Voting App (App.js)

import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button, FlatList, TouchableOpacity } from 'react-native';
import io from 'socket.io-client';

// Connect to the backend server
const socket = io('http://localhost:3000');  // Replace with your server URL

export default function App() {
    const [issues, setIssues] = useState([]);
    const [votes, setVotes] = useState({});

    useEffect(() => {
        // Listen for real-time vote updates from the server
        socket.on('newVote', (voteData) => {
            setVotes((prevVotes) => ({
                ...prevVotes,
                [voteData.issueId]: voteData,
            }));
        });

        // Fetch voting issues from your backend API (optional)
        fetch('http://localhost:3000/issues')  // Replace with your API
            .then((res) => res.json())
            .then((data) => setIssues(data));
    }, []);

    const handleVote = (issueId, optionId) => {
        // Call backend or directly interact with smart contract to cast vote
        console.log(`Voting on Issue ${issueId} for Option ${optionId}`);
        // Emit event to backend
        socket.emit('castVote', { issueId, optionId });
    };

    return (
        <View style={{ flex: 1, padding: 20 }}>
            <Text>Voting System</Text>
            <FlatList
                data={issues}
                keyExtractor={(item) => item.id.toString()}
                renderItem={({ item }) => (
                    <View style={{ marginBottom: 20 }}>
                        <Text>{item.name}</Text>
                        <Text>{item.description}</Text>
                        {item.options.map((option, index) => (
                            <TouchableOpacity
                                key={index}
                                onPress={() => handleVote(item.id, index)}
                                style={{ marginBottom: 10 }}>
                                <Text>{option}</Text>
                            </TouchableOpacity>
                        ))}
                    </View>
                )}
            />
        </View>
    );
}

This React Native app:

Connects to the backend server using Socket.io.
Displays the voting issues and options.
Emits votes back to the backend when a user selects an option.
Updates the UI in real-time when new votes are cast.

                )}
            />
        </View>
    );
}
This React Native app:

Connects to the backend server using Socket.io.
Displays the voting issues and options.
Emits votes back to the backend when a user selects an option.
Updates the UI in real-time when new votes are cast.
5. Can This Work on iOS and Android?
Yes, this voting system can work on both iOS and Android using React Native. React Native allows you to build cross-platform mobile apps, and the Web3.js library can be used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain on both platforms.

Ethereum Smart Contract: The contract will run on the Ethereum blockchain, which is platform-agnostic. The interaction with the smart contract is done through Web3.js.
Real-Time Updates: By using Socket.io and a Node.js backend, real-time voting data can be pushed to the app instantly, regardless of the platform.
Mobile App Compatibility: React Native will generate a single codebase that can run on both iOS and Android.
6. Security Considerations
Immutability: Once a vote is cast, it cannot be altered, ensuring trust and transparency.
Real-Time Data Integrity: Using blockchain ensures that no one can tamper with the vote counts, even in real-time.
Authentication: Implement secure authentication (e.g., OAuth or wallet-based login) to ensure that only authorized users can vote.
Next Steps
Deploy the smart contract on the Ethereum network (either on a testnet or mainnet).
Test the app on both iOS and Android.
Set up the backend to handle real-time events, interactions, and securely store and manage data.
Extend the frontend with more features like viewing voting results, creating new voting issues, and providing feedback.
By following this structure, you can create a blockchain voting system that works in real-time, ensures transparency, and is deployable on both iOS and Android.
